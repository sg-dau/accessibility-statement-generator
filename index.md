This is a tool will help you generate an accessibility statement for your website or application. This will help you create a statement that complies with the requirements of the [Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) Accessibility Regulations 2018](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/made).

Creating a fully compliant statement is not somethign that can be done automatically. To complete this you will need the following:

* Information regarding your organisations approach to accessibility.
* Outputs from an accessibility audit or review that identifies any existing issues.

The tool uses your browser local storage while creating the statement. The 'Create new statement' button below will clear this information and allow you to start a new statement. Local storage is not secure storage but given the nature of the information, which will be public anyway, this should not be an issue. The data will persist in your browser's local storage until you clear it out manually or start a new statement.

Note that using this tool does not guarantee a compliant accessibility statement. Much of the information in the statement is provided by you. If insufficient or inaccurate information is provided then the statement created may not be compliant.

  <a id="continue" href="background" class="ds_button  ds_button--secondary">
    Continue existing statement
  </a>
</div>
